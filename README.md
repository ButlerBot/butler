Butler
======

Butler is a simple slack bot designed to make your life easier.  He's a swell guy.

## Getting started

Butler needs a slack api token in order to connect to your organization.

    $ export SLACK_API_KEY=your_api_key

Once you've done that you should be able to install your dependencies and fire up your bot.


    $ mix deps.get
    $ iex -S mix

Butler should now be up and running.
